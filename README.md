# python-fundamentals


This repo contains my Python practice problems and beginner - intermediate projects.


## Structure
- **practice-problems/** -> raw practice files (exercises with comments + code I've written)
- **projects/** -> clean scripts (password analyzer, password manager or log parser)
- **algorithms/** -> problem-solving tasks that focus on logic, does not include not full apps.


## Purpose
Iâ€™m using this repo to practice Python fundamentals, which include:
- Variables and Data Types
- Loops and Conditional Statements
- Functions
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Errors and Exceptions
- Modules and Imports


These files are a part of my learning journey to build a strong understanding of Python.
