This repo contains my Python practice problems and beginner - intermediate projects.


## Structure
- **practice-problems/** -> raw practice files (exercises with comments + code I've written)
- **projects/** -> clean scripts (password analyzer, password manager or log parser)


## Purpose
I'm using this repo to practice Python basics, these include:
- Variables and data types
- Loops and conditions
- Functions
- Data structures
- Error & Exceptions
- Modules & Imports


These files are a part of my learning journey to build a strong understanding of Python.
