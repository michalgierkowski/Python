# Arithmetic Operators

**Source:** HackerRank â€“ Arithmetic Operators

**Goal:**  
Read two integers, `a` and `b`, then print:  
1. The sum (`a + b`)  
2. The difference (`a - b`)  
3. The product (`a * b`)  

## Key Idea
- Use arithmetic operators such as: `+`, `-`, `*`.  
- Print results on separate lines. 

## What I learned
- Must follow what it asks for (in this case - separate lines)
