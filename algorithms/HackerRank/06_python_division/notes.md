# Division

**Source:** [HackerRank - Python: Division](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-division/problem?isFullScreen=true)


**Goal:**  
The first line should contain the result of integer division, a//b. The second line should contain the result of float division, a/b.


## My First Attempt
- First attempt I set two variables
- // -> floor division returns largest integer, rounds down
- / -> true division returns a float, doesn't round 
- result_a = floor division of a // b 
- result_b = true division of a / b
- printed result_a and result_b on separate lines


## Final Version
- Eliminated any pointless code
- Removed variables (pointless)
- Did the division calcuation as the argument for print
- Printed on separate lines


## What I Learned
- Being simple works better
- // = floor division, returns as int and rounds down



## Quick Example
Input: 4, 3
Output: 1, 1.33333333333
