# Weird or Not Weird

**Source:** HackerRank – Python If-Else  
**Goal:** Print "Weird" or "Not Weird" based on the value of "n".

## Key Rules
- Odd -> Weird
- Even and 2–5 -> Not Weird
- Even and 6–20 -> Weird
- Even & >20 -> Not Weird

## What I Learned
- Use `% 2 == 0` for even and `% 2 == 1` for odd.
- “Run Code” uses sample tests, “Submit” runs final code with hidden tests.
