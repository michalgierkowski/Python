# Code 1 - Input
Using expections allocates more memory causes code to be slower and less efficient
The code as well looks more messy when all I'm asking for is a simple input
#while True:
    #try:
        #userInput = int(input("""Would you like to enter:
    #1. Text
    #2. Number
    #Your choice -->  """))
        #break
    #except ValueError:
        #print("You did not enter a valid input.")


# Code 2 - Foward iteration issue

    elif userRequest == "2":
        smallest = values[0]
        ascendingOrder = []


        for nonInt in values:           
            if nonInt == str(nonInt):   - it's better to use isinstance() 
                values.remove(nonInt)
       

        for number in values:
            if smallest < number:
                smallest = number
                ascendingOrder.append(smallest)
        print(ascendingOrder)
        break

I wanted to go through it and remove each element one by one with a for loop it wouldn't work, why?

When using a for loop, I remove a element of current pointer position which causes list to shift to the left
This lead to the pointer being one position foward and skipping the element we wanted to check

Solution code (not finished): 

    elif userRequest == "2":
        for index in range(len(values) - 1, -1, -1):
            if isinstance(values[index], str):
                values.pop(index)  - .pop() is for removing a element based on it's index/position

What we are doing is looping through the list backwards, checking if it's a string 
If it's true we remove the element using .pop and add our "index" variable which starts from last position and stops at first position taking 1 step backwards (start, stop, step).

Example of what was happening previously:
values = ("1","2","3","4") checks "1" and removes but now "2" is in index 0 and 3 is in index 1 - due to list shifting left
index -->  0   1   2   3
The next check for the pointer is index 1 which now holds element of 3, it checks "3" but skips "2" leaving it in the list, this is the result of fowards iteration.
